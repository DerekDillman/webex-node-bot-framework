# Contributing

Contributions, to add new features or address bugs, are welcome as the framework is community supported!

Before commiting final changes to your branch and submitting a PR please make sure to do the following.

## Update version in package.json

Bump the webex-node-bot-framework version number on the third line of [package.json](../package.json).

The framework follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) which uses a MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH version numbering style.

- Bump the PATCH version number when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

- Bump the MINOR version number when you add new functionality in a backwards compatible manner.

- The MAJOR version is bumped when you make non-backward compatible changes.   Do not submit PRs that are not backwards compatible without first discussiong them with the community in the ["Webex Node Bot Framework" space on Webex](https://eurl.io/#BJ7gmlSeU)

## Rebuild the Docs

Much of the docs are automatically generated by the jsdoc comments in the framework code.  If you have touched these to address doc issues or add a new feature the docs need to be regenerated.

If you want to manually update prose sections of the docs do not modify the README.md in the project's parent directory as this is generated.  Instead modify the appropriate .md file in the docs directory.

The `build.sh` script in the project's parent folder generates the README.md for the project.
This build script requires that you have installed the dev dependencies of this project.

To build the docs:
```bash
npm i --only=dev
npm run build
```
(note: the dependencies only need to be installed once)

After rebuilding the docs check to see if README.md has changed and needs to be included as part of your PR.  If you've made a change that requires bumping the MINOR version number this SHOULD be the case.

## Run (and update?) the tests

This pacakage includes a suite of [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) tests that validate the functionality of the framework.  Before submitting a pull request, please run at least the basic tests as described in the [Running the Tests](./tests.md) section of the test documentation.

If your PR includes new functionality, you should add to the test suite.  It is recommended that you familiarize yourself with the tests BEFORE beginning any feature related work.  Please review the [framework tests documentation](./tests.md), before beginning any feature functionality development.
